basic.txt is a very simple test case. We expect the final matches to be:
4 5 6
7 8 9
10 11 12
1 2 3
The order for the first three matches doesn't really matter. They are tied in distance.

conflict.txt is a test where one of the matches will try to use an already matched patient.
We expect final matches to be:
4 5 6
7 2 3
1 8 9

size_diff.txt is a case where groups have different sizes. 
Expected output is:
1 2 3
4 8 10

dist.txt checks that both prop scores are used and that distance is calculated as expected.
Expected output:
4 5 6
1 2 3

big_test.txt
Expected output:
7 8 1
9 6 3
11 12 2
